# Section 1: Overview of WHO Africa Region `r format(today, "%d/%m/%Y")`
## Overview
 
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
 

```{r mapWHO, fig.align = 'center', out.width= "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../input_files/WHO_Africa3.png")
```

\newpage

## Methods

We compare the size and rate of increase of the COVID-19 epidemic across the countries included in WHO Africa Region.  
&nbsp;
 

The maps below summarise the in-country situations:  
&nbsp;
 
* Top row: cumulative reported cases (left) and deaths (right).  
* Middle row: cumulative reported cases (left) and deaths (right) per 10,000 population on a log10 scale.  
* Bottom row: overview of weekly ratios of cumulative reported cases (left) and deaths (right). Weekly ratios are calculated by dividing the sum of new cases/deaths over the most recent 7 days by the sum of new cases/deaths during the preceeding 7 days. Doubling times have been replaced by weekly ratios because as country specific epidemics decline doubling times become unreliable. The higher the weekly ratio the faster the national COVID-19 epidemic is growing with weekly ratios below 1 suggesting the epidemic is slowing.

Caveats: 

* Colour scales are non-linear and are re-calibrated every week.

* WHO African region countries shaded in white either have no reported deaths/cases or, for weekly ratio calculations, have reduced their cumulative total cases/deaths in the last 14 days due to retrospective changes in reporting procedures.

# Section 2: Individual country situations
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
 

As of `r format(today, "%d/%m/%Y")`, each panel below shows for each country:  
&nbsp;
 
* Top row: cumulative reported cases (left) and deaths (right).  
* Middle row: cumulative reported cases (left) and deaths (right) per 10,000 population on a log10 scale.   
* Bottom row: weekly ratio of cumulative number of cases (left) and deaths (right) ending on the last 7 days leading up to `r format(today, "%d/%m/%Y")`.

Caveats;

* Retrospective changes in reporting policy may cause cumulative deaths/cases counts to drop as described in WHO Sit Rep Number 105, published on 04/05/2020.

## Data

### Sources and access
- Case counts for countries in WHO Africa Region from WHO Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) situation reports https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports (accessed 2400 `r format(today, "%d/%m/%Y")`).  
- Death counts for countries in WHO African Region from WHO Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) situation reports https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports (accessed 2400 `r format(today, "%d/%m/%Y")`).  
- Population counts from the World Bank (2018) https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=ZG (accessed 0900  30/03/2020).


### Weekly Ratio calculations

We have used ratios of both cases and deaths in the past week compared to the previous week (i.e. the total over the last 7 days as a ratio of the total over the previous 7 days) to monitor the weekly rate of spread of COVID-19. Weekly totals are considered as they are less prone to week day variations than the daily values.  

There is some analogy between the ratios presented and the R number, and values of less than 1 (or greater than 1) might be expected to correspond to R numbers of less than (or greater than) 1. While their values will not be identical, a rudimentary conversion based on a serial interval of 6.48 days (as used in the ICL model) indicates they would be similar. For example, a ratio of 0.70 would correspond to R=0.72, a ratio of 0.80 to R=0.813, and a ratio of 0.90 to R=0.91 (R=Ratio(6.48/7)). However, this analogy assumes uniform reporting over the two week period used to calculate each ratio. Furthermore it should be borne in mind
that each statistic reflects a different manifestation of the virus, and none are fully representative of the true underlying rate of spread of infection in the whole population. Death ratios are heavily influenced by the rate of spread to and within older age groups, and take less account of the rate of spread in younger age groups. Similarly cases and hospital in-patients predominantly include those with more severe symptoms, and so do not fully capture the rate of infection spread within the whole population. Nevertheless these statistics have clear value for monitoring the impact of the virus on health service requirements, and will
still serve as broad indicators of the underlying rate of spread of the virus occurring 3-4 weeks earlier.
  
Confidence intervals calculated using bootstrapping of a simulated dataset with Poisson error structure. 

### Caveats
- Case count data are affected by any changes in testing strategy or testing effort over time and/or any variation in testing strategy or testing effort between regions.  
- Case count data are likely a substantial under-representation of the true number of COVID-19 infections.  
- Death data are considered more reliable but may lag behind case data by as much as 3 weeks.

\section{Extended Data tables}


### Cumulative reported cases
```{r TabIncidenceRaw, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
# Table produced in the analysis script, as it requires the 95%CI, extracted from the simulations

dat.cumsumraw.df <- 
  WHO_latest_day_cases_and_deaths_simulated %>%
  transmute(Country = country,
            `Cum. reported cases` = last_day_case_obs,
            `95%CI lower` = last_day_case_ci_low,
            `95%CI upper` = last_day_case_ci_high) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Cum. reported cases`))

kable(dat.cumsumraw.df)
```

\newpage

### Cumulative reported cases per 10,000 population

```{r TabIncidence10k, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
# Table produced in the analysis script, as it requires the 95%CI, extracted from the simulations

dat.cumsum10k.df <- 
  WHO_latest_day_cases_and_deaths_simulated %>%
  transmute(Country = country,
            `Cum. reported cases per 10k pop` = last_day_case_obs_per_10k,

  arrange(desc(`Cum. reported cases per 10k pop`))

kable(dat.cumsum10k.df)
```

\newpage

### Cumulative deaths

```{r TabDeathsRaw, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
# This does not report CI so directly get it from the data tables

tab.total.deaths<-
  WHO_latest_day_cases_and_deaths_simulated %>%
  transmute(Country = country,

            `95%CI lower` = last_day_deaths_ci_low,
            `95%CI upper` = last_day_deaths_ci_high) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Cum. reported deaths`))

kable(tab.total.deaths)
```

\newpage

### Cumulative deaths per 10,000 populations

```{r TabDeaths10k, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
# This does not report CI so directly get it from the data tables

tab.total.deaths.10k<- WHO_latest_day_cases_and_deaths_simulated %>%
  transmute(Country = country,

  arrange(desc(`Cum. reported deaths per 10k pop`))

kable(tab.total.deaths.10k)

```

\newpage

### Weekly Ratio (cases)

<!-- The following two tables summarise the weekly ratios (for cumulative reported cases and deaths respectively) reported in the above figures. Note that a "NA" value notifies countries where no cases/deaths have been reported yet or have if the first cases/deaths occured less than 7 days ago, preventing the computation of weekly ratio over the chosen 7 day period. A "Inf" value notifies countries where cases/deaths have been reported more than 7 days ago but have not increased since, leading to a zero denominator quotient in the weekly ratio calculation. A "Inf" value may appear for the 95% CIs while an estimated weekly ratio is provided. This occurs when the number of cases/deaths is still very low, leading to the common occurence of flat epicurves in the simulated Poisson error bootstrap from which the confidence intervals are estimated. More cases/deaths are required to provide more reliable 95% CIs in those cases. -->
